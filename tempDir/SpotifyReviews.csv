7/9/2022 13:11,"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",1,318
7/9/2022 13:11,"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime.",2,1

We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify.
