670772142,4,2019-4,Australia,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670682799,4,2019-5,Philippines,"Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman .. Changed by previous Buzz lightyear! More or less d same, but I'm expecting to have something most!!However, my boys like it!!Space Mountain .. Turns into Star Wars!! This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!! Seems more local like Ocean Park or even worst!!They got no SMILING face, but just wanna u to enter n attraction n leave!!Hello this is supposed to be Happiest Place on Earth brand!! But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!",Disneyland_HongKong
670623270,4,2019-4,United Arab Emirates,"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.",Disneyland_HongKong
670607911,4,2019-4,Australia,"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it.",Disneyland_HongKong
670607296,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,"the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong",Disneyland_HongKong
670591897,3,2019-4,Singapore,"Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property.",Disneyland_HongKong
670585330,5,2019-4,India,Great place! Your day will go by and you won't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.,Disneyland_HongKong
670574142,3,2019-3,Malaysia,"Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff.",Disneyland_HongKong
670571027,2,2019-4,Australia,"Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670570869,5,2019-3,India,"I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush.",Disneyland_HongKong
670443403,5,2019-4,United States,Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     ,Disneyland_HongKong
670435886,5,2019-4,Canada,"We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!",Disneyland_HongKong
670376905,4,2019-4,Australia,"We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season.",Disneyland_HongKong
670324965,5,2019-4,Philippines,It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,Disneyland_HongKong
670274554,5,2018-9,Australia,"This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670205135,3,2019-1,United Kingdom,"We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day",Disneyland_HongKong
670199487,4,2019-4,Myanmar (Burma),"Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! ",Disneyland_HongKong
670129921,3,2019-4,United Kingdom,Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesn't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670099231,4,2019-4,Australia,It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience,Disneyland_HongKong
670033848,5,2018-11,Hong Kong,There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!,Disneyland_HongKong
670030877,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  ",Disneyland_HongKong
670022335,3,2019-4,United States,"First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience).",Disneyland_HongKong
670007081,3,2019-4,United States,Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. ,Disneyland_HongKong
669996858,3,2019-4,Singapore,"I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. ",Disneyland_HongKong
669783708,5,2019-4,Australia,"GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait.",Disneyland_HongKong
669548161,3,2019-4,Hong Kong,Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,Disneyland_HongKong
669528186,3,2019-4,Australia,"This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks.",Disneyland_HongKong
669403596,5,2018-12,Philippines,We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!,Disneyland_HongKong
669353396,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,Disneyland_HongKong
669186152,3,2019-4,Australia,"I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). ",Disneyland_HongKong
669093045,5,2019-4,Australia,"Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier.",Disneyland_HongKong
669050447,4,2019-4,Australia,"A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella.",Disneyland_HongKong
668819140,5,2019-4,Australia,"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks.",Disneyland_HongKong
668798543,5,2019-4,China,"This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670801367,5,2019-4,United States,"This place has always been and forever will be special. The feeling you get entering the park, seeing the characters and different attractions is just priceless. This is definitely a dream trip for all ages, especially young kids. Spend the money and go to Disneyland, you will NOT regret it",Disneyland_California
670760708,5,2019-4,United States,"A great day of simple fun and thrills. Bring cash, nothing is cheap, but we knew that it's Disney. But they are great letting you bring in your own food, drinks, etc but read the list closely, we list several items at the entry gates (selfy sticks, glass refill bottles, etc). It is worth buying the photo pass and fastpass. Have fun! ",Disneyland_California
670565072,4,2019-5,Australia,All and all a great day was had. The crowds are huge and ride times sometimes up to a 50 min wait but worth it. Very disappointed the castle was under repair and covered but we understood. If you want to take a short cut on the rides grab a Max Pass for 15 each it allows you to book a time every 90mins and believe me it's a great feeling floating past the ques. ,Disneyland_California
670544335,5,2019-4,United States,"Having been to the Florida location numerous times over the years I didn't know how this one would compare. The much smaller footprint made it quicker easier to get from ride to ride. The Cinderella's castle was much much smaller, but also being renovated. Many of the rides were identical, while some were notably different. The Indiana Jones Ride (which FL does not have) was awesome. Space Mountain was much more puke worthy. It's a Small World was way more beautiful from the exterior. They had several of the old rides that FL doesn't have (like Pinocchio and Mr. Toad). I LOVE how their fast passes worked... it was easy to use and we were able to use them back to back on rides, fast passing almost everything we wanted to ride. We went the first week of April and while crowded, I didn't think it was too bad. We were only in the park for like 7 hours and I do wish I'd had about 3 more hours to do everything.",Disneyland_California
670472278,5,2019-4,Canada,"Had the 4 day pass, spent 3 at DL and one at CA. Great place to visit. We will be back. Saw a lot in those days, but there is more that we missed, and more we want to see again.",Disneyland_California
670382191,5,2019-4,Lebanon,Oh my god you can really forget your self and enjoy everything you face there its a huge word of fun,Disneyland_California
670303452,5,2019-3,United States,"We were so sad that the castle was under refurbishment, but we didn   t let it ruin our good time. I purchased the Maxpass before we went and it was super easy to use and very convenient. Maxpass includes free pictures taken by Disney photographers. I have been to Disney World and there is no shortage of photographers. This was not the case here. They definitely need to add more. We were able to do all of the rides that we wanted to do, and we got the snacks that we wanted to try. We spent two days here and on the last day we watched the Fireworks show. It was amazing. All of the workers were polite and helpful. ",Disneyland_California
670215409,3,2019-4,United States,"Took my son to the Park on a weekend(Fri Sun). Very busy all over the places. My son enjoyed it, but he was very sad that he could not try a lot of attractions as the wait time was huge.....( ranging from 60 90 minutes) If you have a lot of time to waste waiting in the line for the attractions, FASTPASS system at the park is just a ripoff. You can have only one attraction added to your plan at any point, once you complete that attraction you can add one more. ",Disneyland_California
670204404,5,2018-11,United States,"There's nothing like Disneyland and it should be on your  bucket list  if you've never been. Park is well maintained and parking is OK, but not cheap at $25. Tickets can cost up to $150 per adult (10 years old and up) during  peak  periods. Food is not cheap either. If you take a family without a season's pass, you could easily spend hundreds of dollars just on admission tickets. If you go frequently, get a Disney credit card to get free park perks and park promotions. Downtown Disney is also a fun place to visit.",Disneyland_California
670164415,5,2019-4,United States,"I think it   s because going to Disneyland is one of my earliest memories, but I just love visiting the park every few years. You won   t find a place with friendlier more helpful staff and the entire park is so clean. Yes, it   s expensive for many and there are crowds, but you can adjust the timing of your visit for fewer crowds and you can visit on a budget if you plan ahead. It   s such a special place for so many people and kids enjoy themselves too. There are loads of online resources on how to visit on a budget such as staying at an offsite hotel and bringing your own snacks and meals. I highly recommend that everyone try it once, but be warned, it   s highly addictive. ",Disneyland_California
669945103,5,2019-4,United States,"I   ve been going to Disneyland since the early 60   s, and the Magic never gets old . This was my 4th visit this year. We have developed a strategy that works best for us. We stay at a Disney resort and you can get in at 0700. We can actually get on about 5 rides in less than 2 hours. As the day goes on the crowds thicken and wait times are over an hour making it difficult to experience everything. Max pass is worth the extra $. By nightfall the crowds can be overwhelming , so early is better. ",Disneyland_California
669762024,5,2019-4,United States,"The last time I was here, the area Disney's California Adventure now occupies was the parking lot; it was magical then and through the years and changes, the magic remains. This was the first visit for my wife and daughters and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. I could go every year and never get tired of it (I understand why some people opt to get annual passes)!To guard against disappointments; research, research, research. I cannot stress that enough. If there is an attraction that you have your heart set on experiencing, check multiple sources to see if it is undergoing a refurbishment and what the timeline for said refurbishment could be. I knew castle would be encased in scaffolding and would not be visible during our visit. However, it did not detract from our experience. If you have friends and or family members who recently went, hit them up for advice and learn from their experiences.Another thing, expect crowds regardless of what time of year it is. Granted, some times of the year can be busier than others. We were fortunate that the time we were here, crowds were not overwhelming, fastpass return times were reasonable, and we didn't have to wait too long on the rides where everyone rides standby.Use the app; it will really, really help you;seeing standby times and fastpass return times can help you adjust your plan to how things are at the moment or help you decide what to do next. It will also help you locate where specific characters are and when they will be there.Lastly, I highly recommend seeing Mickey's Soundsatonal Parade from start to finish. I also highly recommend seeing both night shows (Fantasmic & Mickey's Mix Magic). If you want to catch the earlier Fantasmic show, you should probably go get your fastpasses for it right after rope drop as the earlier show will likely go fast. By the time I went to get our passes, only the later showing was available.",Disneyland_California
669706763,3,2019-4,Canada,"This is going to be a lengthy review, only because this trip had been planned for over a year. Let's start with the lines. Now, myself and 4 others had planned this trip for over a year, we went Easter long weekend and we already were fully expecting it to be busy. We had a 5 day park hopper pass to be able to get on everything and enjoy both parks fully. The Friday, and Sunday were the least busiest days and the most enjoyable. But, there are lines for everything! Lines to get your bags checked, lines to get in, sometimes lines well past the monorail and took 30 minutes or more and lines for rides of up too 120 minutes or more! These parks are so packed full its impossible to move around. Fast pass is a joke unless you get to them early! Got a fast pass at 10 am and was to come back at use it at 6:30pm! The rides: With the 5 days we did manage to get on everything at least twice. But more often then not Indiana Jones was broken. Space Mountain went down a few times, Splash Mountain went down, Big Thunder Mountain, Incredibles Coaster, pretty much everything was broken at one time or another. Waited in line for 45 minutes for Cars before being given a fast pass and told it was broke at about 7pm, it never did reopen that night. If you only have a day pass or hell even 3 days the wait times and the amount of broken down rides would make it near impossible to get on everything. Food: Maybe I am picky, but my friends agreed it was near impossible to find anything decent here. The Red Rose Tavern wasn't bad but it was fast food and it wasn't exactly cheap or anything to rave about. Odered a burger and it was ready before I was done paying! The Grey stuff was pretty delicious though! I can't understand why the Bengal Barbeque has such great reviews. It cost me $5:50 for a chicken skewer that has 3 little pieces of chicken on it! We did the $30 dinner and Fantasmic tickets with the Hungry Bear resturant and what a joke! You got a piece of chicken and or salmon, Rice with cranberries and peaches in it (yuck!) And a arugula salad with chick peas. It came in a plastic container like something from a cafeteria. The Blue Bayou was the only place in Disney that was absolutely blow your mind fantastic. It is not cheap however it was a splurge dinner. The best food we food was outside the park! Better food and prices! Ot is nice they let you bring in water and food now since a water bottle cost $4.50! The churro stands were really good and so was the popcorn stands. The Wine Country Trattoria in California Adventure was very good! Amazing pasta and wine pairings and we did the World of Color package and we got excellent seats for $50 a person. The shows: Fantatsmic and World of Color are incredible and must watch while your here! Get there early to get good seats and don't be suckered into the dinner and show packages for Fantasmic! The one through Hungry Bear was a massive disappointment! The food was terrible and we were told to get there by 8pm but they had already started seating people way before that! We were sat on the side and were obstructed by lamp post and a gate! We saw Fantatsmic the second night and went early, stood on the bridge and it as a primo spot! The World of Color we did the dinner and show through The Wine Country Trattoria and there the food was fantastic and the seats were right up front! That was a $50 package and that was worth it! Overall I've learned a lot from this experience. I would love to come back but may better select our dates. From reading other reviews though sounds like they over pack these parks no matter the time of year. For how much you pay, the wait times and food are just not worth is. Eat outside the park, get fast passes when you can. Hope lady luck is on your side and the rides aren't all broken down. For how much money they must make the rides are always broken!!It was fun, made some great memories, I guess I just expected more but if felt like a money grab everywhere you turned. ",Disneyland_California
669660324,2,2018-10,United States,It is no doubt a legendary place but I just dont think it's worth the money and headache of overcrowding and overpriced everything. Disney continues to raise the price of admission and the crowds are ridiculous every single day. There are plenty of things to do in SoCal that are cheap or free. Save your family hundreds of dollars and go somewhere else. ,Disneyland_California
669624661,5,2019-4,United States,I always love to go to Disney land. The kids have a blast as well as adults.  Downside is that it's to crowded not alot of room,Disneyland_California
669535760,5,2019-4,United States,"Who knew? Easter Day is light! No line was more than 25 minutes wait, and that was the popular rides! Great day   definitely hit Indiana Jones, Thunder Mtn & the Matterhorn.",Disneyland_California
669505006,1,missing,United States,"I   ve been to Disneyland several times in the past 3 decades. This visit, I sensed the employees were disgruntled or unhappy. Very few smiles from the staff. In addition, the staff was prowling for people crossing the ropes while Fantasmic was on. Why do we need a Fastpass to enter to watch the Fan tasmic show when everyone has been situated and there is tons of space for paying customers without a Fastpass? See attached picture. Through the whole show, the entire space was unoccupied while there were 5 8 yr olds next to us straining to catch a glimpse.If you wanna pay $129 to stand in line for hours to ride an average of 9 rides that last 3 to 11 minute, this is the place for you. Disneyland has become so greedy that they overcrowd by double capacity just to make money without a care for their customers. It   s ridiculous to have minimal places to sit and rest with this large of a park. I highly recommend Universal Studios VIP pass over this mess.",Disneyland_California
668986571,5,2019-4,United States,Last time I was there was for Grad night in 1978. My wife won Disney tickets for 4 so we took our youngest granddaughter. Many of the sights I remember and haven't changes a whole lot.The experience was great and i thought the afternoon parade was outstanding. Definitely will not be waiting another 40 years before returning.,Disneyland_California
668793602,4,2019-4,United States,"Honestly,if you are reading this review then you are seeking different tips for the Disneyland park experience. Once you decide to visit, there is no turning back. Every person should have at least one experience with Mickey, Minnie and their entourage. Hack 1.Prepay your ticket. Park at Downtown Disney. Parking rate is the same at the park. Every minute counts and waiting to park then catch the tram is wasted minutes. Board the monorail located in Downtown Disney and you will be delivered in Tomorrowland (near space mountain). That's right, you skip all entry lines. Your pre purchased ticket is entry at the monorail boarding station. If you desire to take pictures at the entry of Disneyland then this is not a hack for you. Hack 2.The Disneyland Railroad, East of the monorail deboarding station, takes you around the entire park and different entry points of the various lands. The train ride is fun, it is an actual attraction, and you see much of the park, and boarding at Tomorrowland is less crowded than the other points. I highly recommended that you complete the full tour and then map your experiences of what to do next. Pirates of the Caribbean is always a long wait. I would recommend to begin your day in New Orleans Square, where much of the popular attractions are located.Hack 3.Late November to early January is the most beautiful time of the year to experience Disneyland. I find it less crowded and wait line times are 60 minutes and less. I've been going to Disneyland when there were colored tickets to get on the rides. Did I just date myself?Disneyland is overpriced. Food is uneventful, yet the New Orleans Square has good food. Food is pricey. Lines can be so long that your 8 hour day may only be 4 rides. Families come to Disneyland for a technology alternative (togetherness), unfortunately, the long lines will tempt you to take out your phones to entertain your children rather than endure the complaining. Parades and other events are worth delving into. Let me know how these hacks optimize your experience.",Disneyland_California
668772767,5,2019-1,Australia,Pure magic for both children and adults alike. Happiest place on Earth   how can you not be happy at Disneyland! Sure it is a little expensive but when you really immerse yourself in the experience it is money well worth spending. We had 4 days   3 nights and purchased the park hopper tickets. Definitely recommend the park hopper as you can come and go as it suits. ,Disneyland_California
668759002,4,2018-5,New Zealand,"Great place for people like me that prefer the more relaxing in life than the thrill seekers.Its never been a cheap destination and it has only increased in price but I would still recommend it at least once Pirates of the Caribbean, Big thunder railroad, Indiana Jones rides have always been go to for me",Disneyland_California
668734266,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We found this park to provide family friendly fun with a variety of shows and rides. We pre paid our tickets to save time which was a benefit and were glad we paid extra for the park hopper tickets which give flexibility to move between the parks as you wish over the days to suit the rides   attractions you want to do. I enjoyed this park the most. There is a range of eateries so not just fast food and there are lots of shopping options for Disney merchandise if that   s what you like.We enjoyed the mix magic fireworks   music   light show every day and only wished we had watched the other show also. The parade was fun too and both were impressive.There can be long queues for some rides but waiting times vary and are displayed to inform your decision although fast pass could be purchased for an extra cost when we visited. We also found that around show   parade times queues reduced for some rides.,Disneyland_California
668730191,2,2019-4,United Kingdom,"My partner and I paid $149 each for tickets to this park as my partner wanted to see the original Disney castle.When paying for the tickets nothing was mentioned about a couple of issues we had.Firstly we walked through and tried to take a photo using a selfie stick to be told we either have to throw it away or take it back to the car or hotel as they are banned. So we had to leave and come back again.Then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying, but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn   t even visible as they are working on it or something. It was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us.We should have been told as we   d have left the park for another LA holiday and not wasted $300.Disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment The only good thing was out breakfast in the Carnation Cafe where the staff were superb and the Apple cinnamon pancakes to die for.All in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to Disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out.",Disneyland_California
668642940,5,2018-7,United States,Disneyland is always a magical place to visit with friends and family or even on your own for a day!,Disneyland_California

Stay for the fireworks down Main Street. Plenty of wifi hot spots, food stores and great gift shops..unexpectedly good rides like the Small Small world in Fantasyland are a must...",Disneyland_California
668473655,5,2019-4,United States,"This was our first visit to Disneyland after two previous visits to DW. We felt slightly cheated as they were refurbishing the castle and it was closed down, however, we had a great time. We did the adult only thrill seeking ride thing. We really enjoyed Indiana Jones (but make sure you   re in the front), The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean rides. HM and Pirates are both much better than DW. ",Disneyland_California

I really wanted to go to California adventure. So glad i was out voted. Disneyland is so adorable and quaint compared to the much larger Disney world. The lines were much shorter, the people much friendlier and you could see the parade right from the lines! It was great. Happy I went.",Disneyland_California
668118511,4,2019-4,United States,So here are the pros:Lots of characters located throughout the parkFun rides Incredible shows Overall atmosphere ConsLong lines Fast pass not what you think (although it does help) Not as many rides for the 11 year old plus compared with other parks Summary : nice place to visit at least once in your life to say you have been there. We really enjoyed the overall atmosphere at Disneyland but the fast pass was not what you think as you can get two to three rides per day. For adults that are pretty chill waiting in long lines isn   t a big deal but with crazy twins it can make it a little challenging . Wish there was a true fast pass you could pay extra for to make the overall experience better. I   d give it a solid B grade wise but liked Universal much better ,Disneyland_California

667955757,1,2019-1,Australia,"To all who comes to this happy place, welcome. Well Walts vision has been lost along the way over the past few years as this is my third and final trip to Disneyland. I have never experienced so many rude and obnoxious staff throughout the park as we did this time. If the staff are that unhappy with their jobs or pay then step aside and give a job to someone who wants to work. Disney has just turned into a massive cash cow who can't handle the large crowds but keep jamming people into the park until it becomes uncomfortable. We were fully aware of the large crowds of the Christmas period but disneyland promoted activities for you to enjoy and when we arrived at these events people were being moved along by staff, saying that you cannot stand there.Disney have made WiFi available in the park aswell and this just leads to people not watching where they are going because all people are doing is looking at phones instead of watching where they are walking.Do yourself a favor and go to Knotts Berry Farm, its a lot cheaper and not as crowded.",Disneyland_California
667949122,5,2019-3,United States,"The original is the best, and taking my kids gave me the chance to feel what my parents did 30  years ago when they took me. The park does everything right, from the decor, to the facilities, to the staff.Pay extra for the MaxPass feature with photos. It's excellent, allowing you to get Fast Passes on your phone, and get the staff to take your picture for you.The rides ate great, and so are the shows. Can't say enough good things.",Disneyland_California
667858131,5,2019-4,Canada,Had a fun couple of days :) FastPass was so worth it! The park is not as big as I expected and you could pretty much see do everything in two days.

667491422,5,2019-4,United States,"This was our first trip to Disneyland. We live on the East Coast and I have been to Disney World many times (like 30 ). I actually found some things at Disneyland to be nicer. Likewise some things I prefer at Disney World. I wouldn   t say one is nicer than the other, just different. Even the same corresponding rides are different at each park. For example, I found the Haunted Mansion and It   s a Small World to be nicer here and Splash Mountain better at Disney World. I love that they have a parking deck at Disneyland. It   s only been there since 2001 or so because where California Adventure is now is what used to be part of their parking lot. I think it looks very nice that the sidewalks are brick as a pass to the pink colored concrete of Disney World. The brick looks more aesthetically pleasing. Cinderella   s castle at Magic Kingdom Florida is prettier though I think it looks very nice that the sidewalks are brick as opposed to the pink colored concrete of Disney World. The brick looks more aesthetically pleasing. Cinderella   s castle at Magic Kingdom in Florida is prettier than Sleeping Beauty   s though.

Period, end of story...love it or leave it! Year after year we make at LEAST one trek to this place in Anaheim, CA to revel in our own Epicureanism! And it   s worth every penny. Parking at this point is $25 per day (preferred parking is more). Tickets start at $140 per day (at the ticket booth).

We have NEVER had the experience where we were disappointed due to the amount of people in attendance. Blackout days WILL BE CROWDED...that   s why they are    Blackout days   ! Be sure to stay long enough to enjoy the evening FIREWORKS (SPECTACULAR and EVERY night)! Planning 6 months to a year in advance is your best bet.

I recently broke my leg and was expecting on renting a wheelchair. I ran into on of my old friends who worked at valet. After catching up for about a half hour I politely asked if they had wheelchairs so I didn   t have to walk to the whole way to the park. In a blink of an eye he went back to the back room and pulled one out for me. I had a fully automatic wheelchair for the park. Disney   s cast and crew were extremely accommodating in regards to the chair. Saved the trip!,Disneyland_California

666801789,5,2019-3,Australia,Loved loved loved. Not my first visit to a Disney park but it was absolutely great. Wait times were a little high as it was in the beginning spring break but def worth it. Food is a little expensive so if you want make sure you fill up on a massive breakfast to sustain you though the day. Unfortunately the castle was under refurbishment or something as it was all covered up which was sad but hey Disney is Disney : ) ,Disneyland_California

We loved every minute of it. The classic rides are still so fun and remarkable to think of when they were created. The newer ones are super fun and thrilling. We all had different favorites   Space Mountain, Star Tours, Autopia, Jungle Cruise, Big Thunder, Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain. The employees are incredibly helpful and kind.

I would recommend the Maxipass to make full use of your time in the park. ",Disneyland_California
666498247,4,2019-4,United States,"I just went back for the first time in 18 years. DLR is showing its age but it is still fun. There is a lot of work being done around the park which takes away a little of the atmosphere. More than a couple of the rides stopped mid ride. The frequent interruption is off putting. It was very busy but that was to be expected. Most lines moved fairly well. Definitely take advantage of the single rider lines at DLR and DCA. If you don't mind your party being split up a little, it is a huge time saver. I was able to ride Matterhorn, Space Mountain and Indiana Jones many times with little wait.",Disneyland_California

If you do not have a lot of time to spend at the park than I cannot stress enough how worth it the maxpass is. We paid $45 for the day and we had done all the rides with fastpass by midday which left us enough time to do the rest of the rides by early evening. We found this park to be kept very clean and the rides were great. I liked the classic rides that are not in Florida. Most of the rides that are the same as Florida are not the same. Space Mountain, Small World, Pirates, are all better at Disneyland, in my opinion. The monorail is better too. The employees here were fine but definitely not as  Disney  as they are in Florida. I don't really care about that, but I definitely noticed it. They don't seem that interested in talking to guests, most of them were chatting with other employees and not paying attention to guests and that would never happen in Florida. Also, the food options are better on Florida in my opinion.

Disney are excellent with disability access and cater to all types of disabilities, both visible (wheelchair users, etc.) and invisible (autism, etc.), we managed to get on a lot of rides because with the pass you don't queue in the normal queue but the entrance for disabilities. I can only fault one thing when I went we met Spider man and had photos taken but you have to pay for the photos and they are very expensive, even to just pay for one photo. The food wasn't spectacular but it was edible and nice, there is a variety of food outlets so there was plenty of choice.

We only went on 2 rides (Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom which was fast & furious fun & Pirates of the Caribbean which was amazing!) & enjoyed them both. We also liked walking through Aladdin's Enchanted Passage. The different 'worlds' are colourful, well done & heaven for kids & adults alike. We ate at Silver Spur (in Frontier Land) after a loooong wait to get a table even though it wasn't busy inside (?) & food was decidedly average despite the high cost.

670535589,5,missing,France,A Trip to Disney makes you all warm and fuzzy and an actual kid again. It's not as big as the US one but makes a fun filled happy day out. We went on the rides possible and they were incredible. By the end of the day you are exhausted but nothing a good coffee won't solve to get you till the fireworks show starts. It's magical and so enchanting it takes you back to being a kid watching your favorite Disney movies in those few minutes. Be cautious though if you doing a day trip the last train is at 12pm so you literally run for your life in order to get pass the crowds and get into the train to avoid being left behind. This was the highlight of my eurotrip. ,Disneyland_Paris

I also managed a photo with sleeping beauty and became her prince for a short moment! It is a great place to visit if you want to let the child inside you out for a few days.

Rides are so exciting. So many you'd need a few days there to do them all. Great for all the family. The 10pm fireworks show extravaganza is an absolute must. Get there around 90 mins before for the best view. Handy popcorn stall in the area to keep you all awake! Best ride in big thunder mountain. I did do starwars hyperspace mountain but it made me feel sick for 4 hours afterwards. Our 8 year old absolutely loved it though. Between 9pm and 10pm the queues for the rides in discovery land were under 20 mins. Did startours (3d simulator) twice in a row.

People that do not have that much to spend will be held back, because people with money obviously can skip the lines...absolutely ridiculous.Getting something to eat was horrible, again lines everywhere...just to eat someting right...And don't get me started on the staff, trying to figure out the amount of 3 icecreams with a small casio computer, and not being able to, or very rude staff. Only 2 ladies were friendly, have to be honest.

It is an Imaginaires creation that is amazing.Perfect execution of bringing the movie into a ride and then walking into the Shey Remy caf   and smelling all the good French food.Hyperspace mountain is the funnest ride there. I loved how they finally brought Star Wars into a ride. It was amazing and not a long wait..We got the fast pass for one ride each and worked very nicely and also on your ticket you have three fast passes that can work on other rides. So I think that is the best option. It wasn   t super crowded that day but it was good to get out of the cold. We thought both parks were a lot of fun both were clean. Right now though there is a lot of renovation in Hollywood studios park so not a lot of rides there.I really do like the layout of the park and the castle was beautiful. It didn   t have the magic of Disneyland in America but it   s still a good resort.,Disneyland_Paris

669422346,3,2019-3,United States,"After multiple visits to the original Disneyland in the states, we were so excited to make a trip to her sister park outside of Paris. The park itself is stunning, with gorgeous details and a castle that took our breath away (we kept pausing to admire it as we walked by!). We also loved the dragon in the dungeons  that's a must see for sure.The parks were clean and not too crowded, but they definitely lacked the personality and  Disney magic  of the American park. Cast members were subdued and not very interactive, the parade (Pirates and Princesses) wasn't up to par with the ones we've seen stateside, and the dining options were few and *very* crowded.The secondary park, Walt Disney Studios, was difficult to navigate and really didn't have much we were interested in seeing. We rode Tower of Terror and the Ratatouille ride and went back to Disneyland proper.All in all, it was nice to have had the chance to visit, but neither of us really wants to go back.",Disneyland_Paris

The girls had a ball. And it was no where near a busy as Disney World.The only thing I recommend is   GET TO YOUR BUS EARLY ON DEPARTURE We were there with plenty of time, however we witnessed a couple of families get left behind & this would be the fast thing you would want after spending a full day at a theme park!

669121201,2,2019-4,Switzerland,"We went to Disneyland Paris during the Easter break with family members who had come over from the States. As we had all experience Disneyland in Anaheim and Disneyworld in Orlando, perhaps our expectations were just too high. First off, the moving sidewalks from the parking lot to the park entrance were broken. Not a great first impression. Furthermore, there was a lot of gardening work ongoing when we arrived. Isn't Disney supposed to be magic, with everything looking in top shape and perfect? The security line moved, but was the first bottleneck. The second major bottleneck was to actually enter the park. As we had bought tickets online, we thought we would be able to enter the park fairly easily. However, there was pretty much mass chaos at the ticket check point, with many people jumping the queue and others just standing around. We eventually made it through and made our way to Fantasyland.We managed to ride a few rides, but when it came time to get on the Teacups, they had closed the ride. Not for the day, but for about 45 minutes to disperse the line. This caused many people just to loiter around the entrance, waiting for the ride to open again. Not great. We did manage to eat lunch  early  enough that we didn't have to wait a long time. However, the food that we got was not what we ordered. None of us had the wherewithal to go back and try to fix the order. so we just ate what we got. When it came time for ice cream, it took about 45 minutes just to get to the front of the line, and then another 10 minutes to process the order. This was because the staff at the counter were poorly trained, and only one person knew how to use the register, and others seemed like trainees. There were plenty of other foodcarts around the park that were empty. Not enough staff at the park to operate these. There were also plenty of rides (like Autopia and Dumbo) that were closed for renovation. Disneyland Paris does not carry the iconic felt mouse ears. We definitely won't be going back, and I can't recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone who is looking for a true Disney experience.",Disneyland_Paris

There is so much to do and even more to see. You have a lot of rides, beautiful shops, cafes, everything you could want and more. From my trip to Paris, this has definitely been my favorite part. We went on a Monday, so we didn't have to wait in lines for too long, so if you can I recommend visiting on a working day.",Disneyland_Paris
668481494,5,2019-4,United States,"As season pass holders to Disneyland in California, we love and know Disney well. But we definitely underestimated how huge this park is.

That being said, we are definitely planning to come back again and spend more time. It   s beautiful and clean and a fabulous Disney experience!",Disneyland_Paris

668269058,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"First time at Disneyland Paris and had the most magical time. Loved that there were bigger rides for thrill seekers. Wait times not always accurate which was annoying as you lined up for a 20 minute wait and 45 minutes later still waiting, some rides refused to change wait times. However, there was no monitoring of people cutting the line which added to the wait time. Staff were so wonderful and patient after I hurt my foot which meant it took me longer to get on and off rides. Staff were helpful when rides broke down and provided answers instead of    I don   t know    or    I can   t tell you   . Staff spoke good English and were very kind and helpful. Food was expensive so we took sandwiches the second day we went. Lines for food were residentially long with only one or two people serving. Unfortunately some of our food was cold but the line was too long to take it back so we ate it anyway. Brought a meal deal which included an ice cream however the only option was a nut one which I couldn   t eat with no other option. The fire works were amazing. We were able to sit right in front of the castle which meant we had an amazing view. Can   t wait to visit again.",Disneyland_Paris

They build the place years back and they are now just collecting cash without any effort, it does not compare in anything with the American parks which are truly amazing. The whole park now is designed to get money from their guests on every step without offering any services. The staff are truly miserable and seems like they hate their job. In the whole park there were no characters walking around at all so a kid can take a picture. There were 3 characters who a kid could meet in the whole park but you had to wait forever just to take a picture. Many rides where closed and the wait time for anything was 60 minutes or more, who in the world can make a a kid stand still in a waiting line for 60 Minutes or more? Avoid at all costs especially if you have young children. PS. Parking is    30 to park 30 minutes walk from the entrance after spending    75 person for your ticket...just ridiculous ",Disneyland_Paris

Since it was Easter and we are on holiday we decided to take our 8 year old for the day. I figured with it being Easter maybe they would have an egg hunt or some fun Easter things   WRONG. It was business as usual. We arrived at 10 am and 30 minutes later she rode the carousal. We waited 90 minutes for a roller coaster, 45 minutes to get sandwiches for lunch, 60 minutes for another ride. It was crowded, disorganized (don't bother shelling out more money for fastpass) and even my 8 year old said it didn't have the enthusiasm of Florida. I would like to say the workers were very kind but the guests were aggressive. As a parent i would expect better behavior   after all it is a family theme park. 7 hours   3 rides. Not worth the price.",Disneyland_Paris
668146454,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"This was just a gorgeous day for us and our 9yr old. We stayed in the centre of Paris and took the RER train (red A line) return tickets for the 3 of us was 38euros. It is the last stop on the line and you exit from the station in front of the entrance. You just can   t stop smiling once you enter   felt like being on a film set. We arrived when it opened 10am and headed straight for the ride we didn   t want to miss out on. There was still a queue but moved quickly. Like other reviews have said you have to queue, minimum 60mins or more for each ride so prioritise the ones you want to do. We didn   t do Walt Disney Studios as we didn   t think we   d have time and we were right. The parade at 5.30 is not to be missed but get your place at the front at least 30mins early as it gets very busy. The ending (10pm) is spectacular, a wow factor. Take lots of snacks, a pack lunch, there are water fountains available. Just be aware some restaurants close by 5.30 6pm. It was a fab day even though it involved a lot of queuing for rides, meet and greets, food, toilets etc. We plan to return soon!",Disneyland_Paris

668123744,2,2019-4,United Kingdom,"I know Disneyland is a money machine but hadn   t realised how much service and enjoyment had been sacrificed to achieve this aim. We visited with our 2 grandchildren and entered the park just after the gates opened. Even then it was manic, probably too many people for the park to cope with.The story was Q,Q and Q. The worst was Peter Pan, the board outside said a 100 minute wait but this became an actual 127 minutes! The reason for this is Fast Pass. As a day visitor you are a third class customer. The pecking order starts with those who are on special deals in the resort hotels, then comes those who have paid even more money for Fast Pass. These people are able to queue jump leaving you to watch as they go to the front of the line. The Q situation extended to the catering facilities, even a coffee took 42 minutes. The guy was morose, monosyllabic and unhelpful. There were a number of these    solo    food stations around the site and all seemed to have the same issues. Having visited Disney in California a few years back and loved the experience, Paris was an awful, poor value experience and will not be repeated.",Disneyland_Paris

668036416,3,2019-4,United Kingdom,"My advice is to get there early, we arrived at 10am and didn   t get into the park until 11.45am. It cost    30 to park the car and we were so far back it was a long walk, you then have to queue at security and the entrance so by the time I got in I felt stressed. However another    45 later we leave the first shop with mickey ears and a Star Wars hat. The park was packed, far too busy and the queues were horrendous it didn   t help that a lot was closed for refurbishment.That being said the look on my daughters face when she saw the princesses on parade was priceless. She was on my husbands shoulders so he missed it as we the crowds to see the parade were bordering on dangerous. We didn   t feel we scratched the surface as the queues were so bad so I don   t feel the cost was worth it. Saying that we   d go again but try and find a quieter time, my tip take lots of money, drinks and food. It even took 30 minutes to buy an ice cream and a coffee.",Disneyland_Paris
668015808,4,2019-2,Australia,"A fantastic way to spend one day (if you are wanting a quick Disney fix) or a week (if you are an avid Disney fan). This is one of two parks within the Disneyland Paris hub and most definitely is the best of the two. The park was clean, the staff were mostly friendly and it was well laid out. The theming was fantastic everywhere but I thought it was particularly good in Frontierland (I believe better than the other Disney parks). Another distinctive characteristic of this park is the extensive amount of hidden gems that you can find scattered throughout. Whether that be the Dragon under the castle, the underground caves in Adventureland or the hidden above ground walk as you enter Frontierland they are must visit places throughout the park (particularly when it is busy). You also cannot miss the extensive attractions on offer, most notably the Rock n Roller Coaster, Hyperspace Mountain, Tower or Terror amongst many more. The only draw back...no one smokes in the designated smoking zones. It is unfortunate this isn   t more heavily enforced.",Disneyland_Paris

Que times are something that need to be looked at as waiting 2 hours with children isn   t ideal this was for a train type ride, A lot of the staff also do not understand English well, I qued in line for an ice cream to eat whilst watching the parade, I qued up for an hour and when it was my turn I realised the reason it took so long was because the staff couldn   t understand what British customers were requesting very well.I would definitely return but would go during term time when it   s not so busy to avoid long ques .",Disneyland_Paris

667866575,2,2019-4,United States,"Having visited the Disney parks in both FL and CA in the states I have certain expectations of the Disney brand and parks and this park fell extremely short. From the initial unorganized entrance to the park to the lack of cast members available, it was a let down. Lots of areas in the park were under renovation while we were there, and there was nothing to make up for it. We were there the Monday before Easter and the crowds were terrible. And let   s add to the fact that visitors to this park will cut you in line and skip through the lines and not blink an eye, super annoying. They do this for all lines. We waited in line for Big Thunder mountain for 40 min only to be abruptly told to get out of line. Apparently the ride broke and that was it. No further explanation, no sorry, nothing. The very few cast members we encountered were unfriendly, unhelpful, and did not have any    Disney    magic. We love Disney and have been visiting the parks annually for the past 11 years. We would never go back to this park. ",Disneyland_Paris

We queued 45 minutes to buy an ice cream on Main Street, only one person serving, our daughter queued 30 minutes to buy a Micky Mouse key ring, again just one person serving in the gift shop.

I think its going a bit far to call it magical though. I wont comment on queues for rides, as you expect this in any theme park anywhere and if it really bothers you there are ways to speed it up of course if you want to pay more. I think what is really lacking though in 2019 is organisation and updating the offering. For a start, nobody should have to queue for an hour to buy a hotdog, the restauarnt areas are hopelessly disorganised and innefficient. The systems just dont work and add so much time. I had about 8 people in front of me on two days to buy 'fast food' and it took an hour. Its also expensive and very limited in choice. Basically if you dont eat junk food, there is not much for you here. There is also nowhere you can charge a phone, not a single charge point in the whole park. And when it takes an hour and a half to queue for a ride, phones etc and quite useful for keeping the kids amused. As there is nothing else going on. It seems so easy to make some improvements that would make the experince so much better and the amount of money being made could surely justify putting a bit back in! Also some rides just seem perpetually closed. Which is annoying when you are returning. The theme parks in UK are a lot more efficient, but I guess they dont have those famous ears to let them get away with it. I call it QUEUEURODISNEY now but will no doubt be back.",Disneyland_Paris
667525007,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"First time to Disneyland Paris. Really enjoyed it.Went with an open mind as my only other Disney experience is a number of visits to Walt Disney World in Florida, that is on a completely different scale and if you go to Disneyland Paris expecting the same, you will be disappointed... It is completely different.First of all my gripe, the fast pass system is rubbish. Doesn't work, means alot of back and forward and wasted time. They need to sort it out.That wasy only issue. The park is clean, familiar with other parks... The layout and amenities, rides and eateries.Had a Caseys Corner, loved that. Beignet, loved that too. Family had a great time.I would recommend a visit, we stayed close by at Dream Castle Hotel and the transport links etc were fantastic.There was one incident that I will be contacting Disney about, wasn't caused by them... But the company I purchased the tickets from in the UK... Feel a situation could have been handled better by them. I haven't marked down on that but felt the way it was handled... Wasnt Disney style.

667308717,2,2019-4,United Kingdom,"We decided to take our 6 year old for a long weekend. I must say we are very disappointed with the experience in general. Whilst I appreciate it was school holidays and the crowds were huge, I cannot see the value in paying so much for passes when actually you are likely not even to make it to 10 attractions over 2 days because of the queues. Some of the attractions were closed for renovation and others just look very tired and dated. The staff are poorly trained and for both days we were sent on a goose chase for our tickets because we had some vouchers. On day one we queued for over an hour!. We had downloaded the passes to our phones and one would expect that just like your plane ticket this should work at the barrier but no it didn   t! Leading us to queue at three different queues as none of the staff was trained enough to to know what to do. On the first day after what felt like endless hours queuing we were given tickets for    both days   , except this was not the case so the same drama the second day, another 70 minutes of queuing. This put us on a back foot for both days meaning we only had limited time and endless queues to endure before we could visit any attraction. The place is also VERY EXPENSIVE for the most basic things i.e. food I paid    37 or so for a meal of fries, a small bottle of water and a fish burger, 1 small portion of fries and 4 chicken nuggets. On day two we decided to leave the park and eat at one of the restaurants by he entrance. It was much more reasonable, it was proper food and peaceful. Merchandise is also cheap and tacky but EXPENSIVE!. We also stayed in a vacation club and not at Disney. This was a great choice away from all tack at Disney.The marvel attractions were ok but they had technical glitches and the queues horrendous. The parade was so busy the little 6 year old could hardly see anything. I know people were queuing since 4 pm for the 5.30 pm parade (what a waste of a day). Same with the fireworks we turned up at 9 ish to find a good patch but taller selfish people just walked in and stood in front of us again he couldn   t see much. I must add that not once did we see Mickey or Minnie except on the float or if we were prepared to queue for ages or book some silly breakfast (more money) with the characters. Why couldn   t they just have a few of these characters meeting and greeting children?. Their app is not very good and doesn   t give much info nor is it interactive enough. Information in general is sketchy unless you sit there planning for weeks. I think if you are a regular or know how to play the game you   d be ok. This is not a destination of once in a life time for a 6 yr old. There is no room for spontaneity. In general I felt we could have holidayed in Africa and seen real lions or the Caribbean and enjoyed the beaches for a better experience for the amount of money we paid. This was just a very tacky, dirty and over priced experience for very little return. I feel the place is so commercial (money, money, money)that the spirit of the magic is lost! ",Disneyland_Paris

We didn   t see many characters around the park and the parade didn   t happen either because of the rain definitely take your own food and drink!

667124936,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,"This was our first trip to Disney with our 6 year old daughter. It is fair to stay she loved it. I have been to Orlando but it was a few years ago and I also loved the park. I would say do some research first in terms of how to make the best of it   fast passes, meal packages etc.We had a fantastic time and loved the rides, meeting the characters, the parade and the fireworks (so much more than just fireworks!). The cast members were always friendly. The park was very clean and well kept. I would recommend downloading the app because it gives you the queue times without having to go to the ride. It definitely helped us plan a bit better. We went to both DLP and Disney Studios. I think Studio's is aimed at slightly older kids and because its smaller it feel busier but we LOVED the ratatouille ride! Probably our favorite of all! Dont miss the fireworks   they are AMAZING. We saw illuminations when we visited.Things that could be improved? Meals and food are eye wateringly expensive! If you are staying at Disney itself consider a meal plan and book some meals before you go (queues are wild). As a vegetarian I lived off pizza, pasta and chips for 5 days which was less than ideal (and i now have a waistline to prove it :D). Disney please could you add some Veggie meals to the menus? :) We are back home with many fabulous memories, tighter jeans and a lot lighter wallets! But we will definitely come again!",Disneyland_Paris

We went on 3 rides a day ! Poor signage and lack of information on site. Queues to meet Disney characters , plus charges for photos. All in all there is no Magic, just a money making concern.",Disneyland_Paris

The rides were typical though. Now it   s updated with more modern rides for adults but it doesn   t have the same feel as Anaheim, which is still our favourite Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris

666869208,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"This was our first Disneyland experience and wow, what an amazing place! The park is immaculate, and the staff are friendly and constantly happy to help! We were concerned that we had seen so many complaints about rude people pushing their way to the front of the parades etc, but we only experienced this twice in our visit and it didn   t ruin our experience. The character meet and greets are brilliant, and worth the queues! Make the most of extra park hours if you stay in a Disney hotel, as queues for rides do get rather long! We went with the rule that if the queues were longer than 30 mins, we didn   t queue and we managed to do all the rides we wanted to using extra park hours and going on rides during parade and illumination times (once you   ve seen them once, you don   t need to see them again, they are the same every day!)We will return to this lovely park in the future.....starting saving the pennies now!!",Disneyland_Paris
666738327,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Park, Paris is a wonderful, magical place which makes me forget any stress and completely relax to enjoy a family holiday. We have visited many times but this was the first time we have taken my sister, nephew and niece with us. It was fantastic to share our favourite rides, experiences and the magical atmosphere with them and see it through their eyes. ",Disneyland_Paris
666692005,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"Wow...nobody quite does it like Disney!Our first family trip (2 adults a 6 year old and a 13 year old).We downloaded the app which is extremely helpful as it gives you the waiting times for all the rides. We bought personalised t shirts and Mickey ears before we left..Disney is VERY EXPENSIVE so be prepared to spend a lot of money on most thingsWe booked breakfast with the Disney characters which was wonderfulThe main strret parade at 5.30 gets super busy so book your pavement slot early (just sit down around 4.45). The fireworks at 10pm are magnificent, we probably should have got there at 9pm for a better viewing place but after 3 full days its exhausting!..we did end up hiring a buggy for our 6 year old as she was so tired by 9pm...its 25 Euros but well worth it should the need ariseOverall...fabulous magical colourful...nobody does it better then Disney",Disneyland_Paris
